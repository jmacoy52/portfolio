    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is Joseph Migbodzi, a junior full-stack developer and IT support professional. I specialize in building full-stack applications using React, Node.js, Express, and MySQL. I design and structure clean UI layouts using CSS, implement authentication, authorization, and role-based access control, and solve technical issues and debug backend logic. I am transitioning from an administrative/IT support background into full-stack engineering, with practical experience building real applications end-to-end.</p>
